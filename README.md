# MIT805-Exam

MIT805exam.java - Java Map Reduce code for getting an initial frequency distribution of the polarity values (i.e. 1 for negative and 2 for positive)

(Towards replicating the initial Java Map Reduce portion, please read comments in code around updating code accordingly based on where you save the input file downloaded from: 
https://www.kaggle.com/kritanjalijain/amazon-reviews
It is also important to have the output path updated all of the way up until the last level folder in the path (i.e. for example have: 
’/Users/michielvstaden/IdeaProjects/MIT805exam/src/main/java’ 
in place, but do not create the ’output’ folder within the java folder before running the code). In case this folder already exists, you will get an error message. This folder is created when the code runs, and the summary of the payment types for the latest information month can be found in this location post running the code.)
